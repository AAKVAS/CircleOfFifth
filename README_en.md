## ðŸ“– Description
The primary feature of the application is the Circle of Fifths, where clicking on chords produces the corresponding piano chord sounds.

Upon entering the application, users encounter a menu with the following sections:
* __Training__: A screen featuring the Circle of Fifths, allowing users to click on chords to compose melodies or practice recognizing chord sounds.
* __Challenge__: This screen presents the Circle of Fifths alongside a button that generates a random sound. The user's task is to find this chord. Total 10 rounds. Each correct answer increases the score by 10 points.
* __Survive__: Similar to the Challenge mode, this screen includes the Circle of Fifths and a button that produces a random chord sound. Each correct answer increases the score until an error is made, resetting the score.
